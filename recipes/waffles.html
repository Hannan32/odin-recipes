        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups rolled oats - use gluten free if needed (160g).
            <li> 2 medium bananas (about 1 tightly packed cup).
            <li> 1 cup your favourite plant-based milk (240ml) (see recipe note below).
            <li> ½ teaspoon baking powder (for fluffier, crispier waffles!)
            <li> 1 scoop protein powder (to make waffles more filling)

        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend oats on high power for 30 seconds until fine flour.<br>Stir briefly to loosen (and ensure they aren't tightly packed in base of blender).
            <li>Add banana and milk (and any optional add-ins) and blend for 30 seconds, until mixture is smooth and lump-free.
            <li>Switch waffle iron on and allow to reach cooking temperature. Using kitchen towel, thoroughly coat all cooking surfaces with oil to avoid sticking.
            <li>Spoon about ½ cup batter evenly into centre of waffle iron, being careful not to overfill.<br>Close lid and cook for 6-7 minutes (or until steam coming out reduces).
            <li>Open iron SLOWLY, leave waffle in place for 30 seconds (to avoid sticking) then gently remove with a flat knife. 
        </ol>
